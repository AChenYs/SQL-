WHERE
    (Employee.DepartmentId , Salary) IN
    (   SELECT
            DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
        FROM
            Employee
        GROUP BY DepartmentId
	);
```
***第二题***
```
SELECT
    (CASE
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) != 0 AND counts != id THEN id + 1
        WHEN MOD(id, 2) != 0 AND counts = id THEN id

***第四题***
可以在执行语句下方弹出来的窗口进行查看。可以查看到执行sql语句之后的的表的信息．


***第五题***
以下摘自ＣＳＤＮ：
ACID指在可靠数据库中，事件应该具有的特性，它不是一种技术，而是一种思想。ACID为原子性（Atomicity）、一致性(Consistency)、隔离性（Isolation)、持久性（Durability)的总称。这个ACID可以分为数据库层面的和业务层面的来讨论，一般业务层面的都可以被转换为数据库层面的。
